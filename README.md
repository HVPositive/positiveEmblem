# Positive Emblem

## What is Positive Emblem?
Positive Emblem is a React JS application that is being made to simulate the mobile game Fire Emblem Heroes. In addition to the regular functions of Fire Emblem Heroes, it aims to have additional features to help the player such as AI prediction, enemy skill forecast (e.g dark shrine will hit which unit) and full buff displays. It is currently, only being built to simulate the mode Aether Raids.

## Why make a simulation?
Fire Emblem Heroes is one of my favorite mobile games and is pretty simple overall. However, a lot of information is not directly displayed to the user but can be known to the player if they are willing to figure it out. This simulation allows the player to get that information without needing to do all the calculations on the spot.

In addition, I wanted to work on a fairly large project and Fire Emblem Heroes is simple and predictable enough that simulating it is not too big of a task while also having enough complexity to not be trivial.

## How can I use this simulation?
Currently, this project has not progressed enough for me to make an initial release.
However, you can run this locally with a clone of this repository. 
You will additionally need to 
install NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/

Install dependecies by navigating to /game then use the command
>  npm install


This should get all of your dependencies and you should be able to start using the command
> npm start

It should then open a tab/window with the address http://localhost:3000/. This is where the simulation will be loaded. In the future, running can done under /game with the command
> npm start
